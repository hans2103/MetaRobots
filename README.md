= MetaRobots

This extension extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Category_View to set the value of meta tag robots to "noindex,follow" on the catalog view page 2 and followup pages.

== Compatibility
Successfully tested on Community Edition 1.6.x
Not tested on previous versions. But feel free to do so and inform me so this readme can be updated.

== Installation
* Download the source code and copy the files in the corresponding Magento folders; 
* mind that you merge the directoriesâ€¦ Do not replace the existing directories. :-)
* no Magento existing file is modified.
* clear cache and enjoy 

After installation you should see that the value of meta tag robots for the followup pages of categories has changed to "noindex,robots".
